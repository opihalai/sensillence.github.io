Timely and accurate information on forest above-ground biomass (AGB) is required for understanding carbon balance, future climate, the sustainability of current politics and the emerging bioeconomy. Optical Earth Observation (EO) in the visible to short infrared spectral region can contribute to this challenge. However, despite optimistic case studies, no global applications using optical EO for biomass retrieval have emerged. The volume of EO data is increasing exponentially and new instruments will measure with better spatial and spectral resolutions, calling for new processing algorithms.

Artificial intelligence (AI) can overcome many of the shortcomings in existing empirical methods for retrieving forest characteristics such as its structure and biomass from EO data. Up to now, AI has been applied to simple canopies with little structure and no woody biomass. Recent developments in deep learning have made it feasible to utilize it for analyzing complex structured vegetation with significant AGB storage such as the boreal forest. We hypothesize that with a carefully selected approach, AI can retrieve the forest AGB which is indirectly, but physically, related to the structural parameters affecting forest reflectance, e.g., crown volume and shape, or tree density.

We propose to use a well-validated physically-based forest reflectance model to simulate the spectral reflectance factors of all possible European boreal forest canopies under different illumination conditions. We will use the simulated spectra and the corresponding AGB values to train AI algorithms such as Bayesian Convolutional Neural Network with Bernoulli Approximate Variational Inference. Once trained, we will apply these AI algorithms to optical EO data from Sweden, Finland, Estonia and Russia, and hyperspectral data from Finland. The AI retrieval results will be compared against forestry data from test sites in each of these regions.

AIROBEST applies AI to facilitate the use of satellite data in global change studies as well as deepen the apprehension of AI methods in industry and society. The scientific goals of the project are to determine 1) the potential of modern AI algorithms in retrieving forest AGB from EO data; 2) the most suitable AI algorithm for performing such a retrieval; and 3) the required EO data characteristics (e.g. spectral and spatial resolutions) for a successful physically-based AI retrieval of forest structure and biomass.
